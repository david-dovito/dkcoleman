Welcome! I'm Matthew Coleman, and this is my personal space on the web.

## What I Do

I'm passionate about technology, AI, and sometimesrandom information. This blog serves as a platform where I share my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge with whoever stumbled upon this super cool blog site.

## This Website

This site is built with modern web technologies including Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It's hosted on GitHub Pages and features a blog powered by Notion for easy content management.
